# 🌍 Top 20 Most Visited Cities in the World 🏙️

This project visualizes the top 20 most visited cities globally, based on the provided dataset. 🗺️ It uses the `folium` library in Python to create an interactive map that displays each city's location, ranking, visitor count, and year-over-year growth. 📍 Markers on the map are color-coded based on their ranking, making it easy to identify the most popular destinations at a glance. ✨

## Introduction 👋

Tourism plays a significant role in the global economy and cultural exchange. ✈️ This project offers a visual representation of the world's most popular tourist destinations, providing insights into visitor numbers and growth trends. 📈 The interactive map allows users to explore the data in a user-friendly way. 👍

## Data 📊

The data used in this project includes the following information for each city:

* **Name:** The name of the city. 🏙️
* **Country:** The country in which the city is located. 🌎
* **Latitude:** The latitude coordinate of the city. 🧭
* **Longitude:** The longitude coordinate of the city. 🧭
* **Visitors:** The number of international visitors (in millions). 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
* **Increase:** The percentage increase in visitors compared to the previous year. ⬆️

## Methodology ⚙️

The project uses the `folium` library to generate an interactive map. 🗺️ The map is centered on a region that provides a good overview of the data. 📍 Markers are placed on the map for each city, with pop-up information displayed when a marker is clicked. 🖱️ The markers are color-coded according to the city's ranking:

* **Red:** Rank 1-5 ❤️
* **Orange:** Rank 6-10 🧡
* **Green:** Rank 11-15 💚
* **Blue:** Rank 16-20 💙

A legend is included on the map to explain the color-coding scheme. 🔑
