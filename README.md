# Top 20 Most Visited Cities in the World

This project visualizes the top 20 most visited cities globally, based on the provided dataset.  It uses the `folium` library in Python to create an interactive map that displays each city's location, ranking, visitor count, and year-over-year growth.  Markers on the map are color-coded based on their ranking, making it easy to identify the most popular destinations at a glance.

## Introduction

Tourism plays a significant role in the global economy and cultural exchange.  This project offers a visual representation of the world's most popular tourist destinations, providing insights into visitor numbers and growth trends. The interactive map allows users to explore the data in a user-friendly way.

## Data

The data used in this project includes the following information for each city:

* **Name:** The name of the city.
* **Country:** The country in which the city is located.
* **Latitude:** The latitude coordinate of the city.
* **Longitude:** The longitude coordinate of the city.
* **Visitors:** The number of international visitors (in millions).
* **Increase:** The percentage increase in visitors compared to the previous year.
* **Rank:** The city's ranking based on visitor numbers.

The data is hardcoded within the Python script.  Future enhancements could include reading data from a CSV file or other external sources.

## Methodology

The project uses the `folium` library to generate an interactive map.  The map is centered on a region that provides a good overview of the data.  Markers are placed on the map for each city, with pop-up information displayed when a marker is clicked.  The markers are color-coded according to the city's ranking:

* **Red:** Rank 1-5
* **Orange:** Rank 6-10
* **Green:** Rank 11-15
* **Blue:** Rank 16-20

A legend is included on the map to explain the color-coding scheme.
